## ðŸ“š Overview

This repository is a curated collection of my Java system design implementations. It covers design patterns, low-level and high-level design problems, scalable architectures, and real-world solutions â€” all written in clean, modular, and production-ready Java code.

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Included

- âœ… **Design Patterns:** Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, and more.
- âœ… **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Parking Lot, ATM, Splitwise, Cache, Rate Limiter, etc.
- âœ… **High-Level Design (HLD):** Scalable systems with modular structure.
- âœ… **Code Quality:** Well-documented, tested, and organized codebase.
- âœ… **Extras:** UML diagrams and detailed explanations where applicable.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repo is meant for practicing system design, preparing for interviews, and serving as a reference for building robust Java architectures.
